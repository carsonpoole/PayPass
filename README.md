# PayPass


This tool is a chrome extension for bypassing the New York Times and Wall Street Journal paywalls.

You totally should not use this tool, under any circumstances. Do not use this.

If you're ignoring my very serious warning, you'll have to add this under chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode, then load the /paypass folder as an unpacked extension.

You can either take my word for it that it's not a virus or anything malicious, or you can inspect the code yourself.
